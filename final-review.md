13. What are the six design assumptions/goals of HDFS?

14. True or False. Explain your answer.

  a. HDFS is a distributed file system with no bottleneck

  b. The Datanodes store and replicate the individual files

  c. Only the NameNode has the knowledge about where the blocks of the files are stored
